	document.getElementById("heritage-container_text").innerHTML = "“If you want to get somewhere, help other people get to where they want to go” may have been the thought that drove a Kingman County farm boy to build a fortune and a transportation system that stretched across America. It all started back when most school kids were riding horses and buggies. But not Aaron Greenleaf. He was whizzing along country roads, over wheat fields and around downtown Kingman on a motorcycle. He kicked up lots of dust and lots of tempers. Aaron loved speed and adventure. He rode over many prairie miles to participate in and spark challenge races in several counties. At 13, he even rode his two-wheeler from Kingman to Colorado and to the top of Pike’s Peak. It was 1910, the summer before he entered Kingman High School. Two years later the spirited teenager was enrolled at the Staunton Virginia Military Academy. Perhaps his parents thought military discipline would temper his adventurous spirit. It didn’t work. After a short while, he ran away from the military school, joined the Army and was soon headed to Europe and World War I. Aaron landed his dream assignment. He became a motorcycle dispatch rider and carried messages to frontline combat units in France. It was one of the most daring jobs in the war. German riflemen zeroed in on motorcycle couriers. After the Armistice, Private Greenleaf was selected to join the elite honor guard for General “Black Jack” Pershing at AEF headquarters in Paris. Returning to Kingman in 1919, his routine became a forage to make living expenses. Amid a grind of odd jobs, Aaron found a way to travel for pay. He borrowed his father’s small sedan and began hauling traveling salesmen between Kingman and Wichita. Soon, he was able to finance the purchase of a Lexington, a seven passenger touring car. With it, he launched Kingman’s first taxi service and started a daily passenger run to Wichita, leaving from the Overland Hotel. Business was spotty. Flat tires, breakdowns and railroads were tough competition. However, when Aaron promised to beat the train from Wichita by two hours, he secured a contract to deliver the Wichita Beacon to Kingman. He began to prosper, and the steady newspaper haul enabled him to extend a passenger and newspaper route to Pratt. The business was named Greenleaf Stage Lines. To take care of expanding business, he created a larger car. By cutting two cars apart and then welding them into one, he doubled passenger and luggage space. He added cars and drivers, and in 1924 took on a partner, D.E. Sauder, a former railroad brakeman. More expansion followed. Aaron designed the first 17-passenger vehicle in Kansas, maybe the first in the nation. Soon they were serving passengers in dozens of towns and three states. The firm’s name was changed to Southern Kansas Stage Lines. Its main office was moved from Kingman to Wichita. Then approval was gained to expand passenger service to San Francisco. They also entered into co-operative agreements with bus lines in the east and began the first transcontinental hookup between the two coasts. Within five years they had 50 buses serving 150 locations. Many of the 10,000 miles the Greenleaf buses traveled were still gravel roads. Expansion was almost continuous. Between acquisition of smaller lines and building their own depots, they launched a trucking business. It grew to encompass depots in 96 cities and 100 employees. Aaron is credited with the development of air conditioning in buses. This came in 1933 after they formed Santa Fe Trailways. Five years later, they sold to Santa Fe Railroad for millions. It was only 19 years after he hauled his first passenger from Kingman to Wichita.”";

	document.getElementById("heritage-container_text").innerHTML = "“Art Rittel was just an average Kingman boy…but he became a hero…and is representative of thousands of young, ordinary boys who became extraordinary when faced with the flames of World War II. Records of Art’s early history are scanty. He grew up in the Murdock area and entered Kingman High School in 1933. His KHS days were uneventful. The school newspaper, with one, small exception, never made note of him. The only time the Oracle included Art was in a story about boys in the advanced manual training class. Appearing in a list of 21 woodworking students, it said Art was building a breakfast table and a cedar chest, ambitious projects for a high school junior. Other than that, Art glided through KHS without notice. In 1937, as a senior, he dropped out of high school to join the Navy. Three years later Art was engulfed in the deadly Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He was uninjured, but a buddy, standing right next to him, was killed as a low flying enemy plane riddled their ship with machinegun fire. “It was tough,” was the way Art described the Japanese strike when he returned to Kingman, two months later, to visit his mother, Mrs. Charles Honey. In route to Pensacola, Florida, for naval flight school, the young seaman also cautioned, “The Japs…are plenty tough. People in the states had better realize that we are at war.” It was 1942, and the last time Art would see Kingman. Following pilot training at Pensacola, the Navy sent Pilot First Class Art Rittel to Europe to fly missions over Biscay Bay, off the coasts of France and Spain. He became commander of a 10-man crew and was piloting a PBY-5 Catalina, the Navy’s “flying boat,” a workhorse plane that served triple duty on reconnaissance, rescue, and anti- submarine missions. Three days short of his first year as a pilot, Art took his last flight. While on anti- submarine patrol, his Catalina was attacked by eight German fighters. The nose gunner of Art’s plane was killed early in the battle. This made the slow flying PBY extremely vulnerable and turned it into an easy target. Art ordered his co-pilot to take over the controls; he then crawled forward to the Catalina’s damaged nose, a very dangerous and primary target area. Moving aside the dead gunner, Art squeezed behind the nose gun and started firing. He shot down one enemy plane and seriously damaged several others before a second blast hit the nose turrent. Art was mortally wounded and died after managing to fire a few more bursts. For his bravery and last-ditch fighting efforts, the Kingman boy was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. It cited him “for heroism and extraordinary achievement…manning the bow guns when his ship was attacked…Rittel pressed home a vigorous attack and with deadly bursts of fire succeeded in damaging several hostile planes. Despite overwhelming odds, he pursued the enemy relentlessly with aggressive fighting spirit and unswerving devotion to duty.” Art is one of 24 Kingman boys who died in World War II. Most were buried with accolades and medals. Art Rittle is a fitting example of their bravery. This gold star fraternity is representative of how a Kingman heritage can make a real difference when challenges beckon. The other 23 are: Richard Bock, Harold Brodock, Charles Buchanan, Marvin Compton, Lyle Dean, George Dondelinger, Jr., Lewis Gillespie, Cleo Hartley, Mitchell Hughbanks, Ronald Kincheloe, Ervin Kiser, Lawrence Koon, Elvis McCutchen, Eugene Moore, Howard Moore, Erwin Naasz, Farrel Nelson, Adrian Richardson, Charles Snell, Eugene Stearns, Robert Surface, Fred Tolar, and Dee Wagner. These boys are a tribute to a bountiful crop that grows in Kingman County. Some call it “The Right Stuff.” It’s a crop with deep roots of independence, persistence and courage.”";

	document.getElementById("heritage-container_text").innerHTML = "“Ben Hibbs strode out of the wheat lands of Kansas into a position of commanding importance in the publishing world. His brilliant career began as editor of the Kingman High School Oracle and rocketed to a gleaming apex as editor of two of America’s most prestigious publications: The Saturday Evening Post and Readers Digest. Pretty Prairie, where his father owned a lumber yard, was his boyhood home. It’s uncertain why he went to Kingman High, 1914-1918, but it planted his life on a one-way track to journalism fame. Only 22 years after leading the high school Oracle, Hibbs took over as captain of the Saturday Evening Post, the venerable magazine that was founded by Ben Franklin in 1728. After graduating from KHS, Ben worked at his father’s lumber yard for a year to earn tuition for the University of Kansas, which he entered in 1919. While in college, he wrote for the Daily Kansan, laid bricks, worked as a janitor, cashier, laboratory attendant, wheat harvester…and still managed to be elected to Phi Beta Kappa, the national honor society for college students. Upon his KU graduation in 1923, Hibbs went on to work at newspapers in Fort Morgan, Colo., Pratt, Goodland and Arkansas City. In between, he taught journalism two years at Hays State College where he founded the journalism department. During this period, he peppered the Great Plains with news stories, editorials and columns which had a refreshing, common sense flair, and they were frequently quoted by other newsmen. It caused a Kansas City Star columnist to call Hibbs, who was 26 at the time, “the most quoted young squirt in Kansas.” A good example of the Hibbs touch was the young editor’s description of Kansas sunsets: “The Lord gave sunsets to western prairies…as therapy for the troubled human spirit.” In 1929 he arrived in Philadelphia as associate editor of Country Gentleman magazine. Then, in 1940, Hibbs was selected editor-in-chief of the Saturday Evening Post. The Post was in trouble when he arrived. Circulation was falling and editorial content was stodgy. The Hibbs touch made its cover more dramatic, art layouts brighter and stories shorter. Those efforts doubled circulation to a remarkable seven million copies a week. His Kansas upbringing showed in much of his editorial philosophy. “Our magazine is read by (people) from all areas of life,” he said. “I make a conscious effort to retain the friendship of the people we try to serve.” But he didn’t serve it all with apple pie and Norman Rockwell art. “If a magazine is to be vital,” he believed, “I think it must deal with dangerous material—material which may bring subscription cancellations or even troublesome and expensive lawsuits.” Hibbs had glory days and nation-wide impact at the Post for 20 years. But he moved on. In 1962, he resigned and went to The Reader’s Digest as its editor, a position he held until retiring in 1972. A pinnacle achievement at the Digest was his collaboration with another native from a small Kansas town, former President Dwight Eisenhower. This team produced four exclusive and highly popular articles about the president’s life. The editor from Kansas had an instinctive feel for America and its people. It gave him a touch any editor would envy. For example, Hibbs wrote, “In the country and the country towns, there is still a stability of life and thought which is our greatest bulwark in time of crisis…herein lies my faith in America.” In his obituary, The Philadelphia Enquirer reported Hibbs once said, “One of the blessings of America has been that a boy might dream his aspirations and then live his dreams.” The paper concluded, “Ben Hibbs…dreamed of becoming a great editor and did just that.”";

	document.getElementById("heritage-container_text").innerHTML = "“For 28 years, in Room 22 at Kingman High School, Beryl Patchen taught freshman English. But her teaching went far beyond conjugated verbs, punctation, and sentence structure. She made Room 22 a knowledge factory that turned hundreds of teenage boys and girls into thoughtful men and women. People are exposed to many teachers throughout their lives. It is the fortunate few who can say that they had one of the game changers, one whom they still think of years later as someone who shaped their lives for all time. Beryl Patchen was one of those. She had a lasting impact on many, many young lives. Years after graduating from Kingman High, two of her former students were reminiscing at a KHS reunion. Both were accomplished PhD’s. One was a physics professor at a prestigious university. The other, head of the history program for gifted students in one of the nation’s largest high schools. “She was my all-time favorite teacher,” remarked the science prof. “The best teacher I ever had,” replied the history specialist. “Better than any I had for my college masters or doctorial programs.” Beryl Hardesty grew up in the Waterloo area and was graduated from Kingman High in 1922. After a summer course at Emporia State Teachers College, she earned a teaching certificate and tackled her first teaching job at Sunrise, a one-room, country school near Waterloo. She came to Kingman High in 1931 and turned Room 22 into a boundless learning center for 28 generations of freshmen. Kids were showered in conjugated verbs and syntax…washed in Tennyson, Byron and Whitman…drenched in “Ivanhoe,” “The Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner” and “The Highwayman.” She often detoured from English and soaked students in hours of lectures about manners, etiquette, and responsibility. Students gave her many nicknames: “Iron Jaw”…”Chief”…”The Boss.” But none ever called her easy. She wore small wire-rimmed glasses in front of ominous eyes that could see through the most devious, mischievous freshman. Indeed, discipline was her hallmark. Like the time a confident and popular boy, with a grand flourish, presented her with a shiny red apple. In an instant, “The Boss” snatched up the polished fruit, pitched it out the classroom window and ordered the crestfallen showman to go schmooze elsewhere. However, if students sincerely held out their cups, Mrs. Patchen would fill them to the brim with knowledge, understanding, and love. Along with English, she was assigned to supervise publication of the high school yearbook and the student newspaper, The Oracle. She had no background in news publishing; yet the school paper became an example of student excellence. Many high school journalism teachers from several states became subscribers and used The Oracle as a pattern for their students to emulate. Mrs. Patchen gave her student journalists a lot of creative freedom, but she also set unforgiving boundaries. Once, every, single copy of The Oracle appeared with a large hole cut out of page three. The airy space was in the gossip column, where an uncensored jibe, along with a teacher’s name, had secretly sneaked past “The Chief.” Her interest in students didn’t stop with their graduation. A former student recounted a touching example. When he and his wife were college students, they were church-mouse poor and going without meals to make ends meet. One day, they received an unexpected letter from Mrs. Patchen. Inside was a twenty-dollar bill, a lot of money for the 1950’s Knowledge, manners and life. Those were Beryl Patchen’s major subjects. She made teaching shine with a magnetic glitter that was forever memorable. Beryl would have been a perfect friend for Lilly Tomlin who once quipped, “I like a teacher who gives you something to take home to think about besides homework.”";

	document.getElementById("heritage-container_text").innerHTML = "“Byron Walker grew quail, pheasants, cottonwood trees, weeds, and history. His crops transformed the economic and leisure welfare of Kingman County, the state, and the nation. In 1947, starting out as a manager for the old Kansas Fish and Game Commission, Byron was assigned to take care of a desolate, over-grazed pasture and a fair-sized pond seven miles west of Kingman. The results were remarkable. He made the barren area into an oasis. It became one of the premier wildlife spots in Kansas….4,685 acres of biodiversity at its best! It has streamside woodlands, native prairies, wildlife food plots, shrub plantings, ponds, a 144-acre state lake, extensive waterfowl wetlands, and it wraps around both sides of the Ninnescah River for eight miles. In short: It’s a prairie paradise for hunters, fishermen, birders, photographers, and picnickers. Many highly credentialed biologists consider the lush habitat a text-book example of their science. Ironically, Byron had zero academic training in biology. He was a high school graduate and a self-taught biologist. His rule of thumb was to spend 25% of his income, every year, on books. And the books he bought propelled him into new frontiers of biology, agriculture, horticulture…any subject that would help foster park improvements. “He was the best self-taught biologist I ever knew,” marveled an officer in the Kansas Fish, Game and Tourism department. “The lessons he gave college trained biologists are still talked about within our department…even after 35 years.” In 1987 the park and Byron made history; It was named the Byron Walker Wildlife Area. This was the first and only time the Fish and Game agency has named any public land after a former manager. Byron was a native of Mankato, Kansas. He and his wife, June, were married in Meade, Kansas, in 1942, shortly after he started working there at the state pheasant farm. Three months later, their lives were interrupted by the Army and WW II. He became a tank driver with the 778th Tank Battalion, part of the Thunderbolt Division which served in General George Patton’s Third Army. Landing in France four months after D-Day, the Thunderbolts spent 176 consecutive days in combat. It was the second longest, continuous fighting time of any American unit in the war. The 778th suffered a 42% casualty rate. Mustered out in 1946, Byron returned to June and peaceful Meade, where he resumed raising pheasants for the state. A year later, they moved to Kingman when Byron was appointed manager of the state quail farm at Callista. Before long, Byron had the empty prairie producing 22,000 quail annually. Later, his mission turned to wildlife habitat development. There was a need for shade and cover. “With the help of the Boy Scouts, the first two years we planted 20,000 trees annually, then 15,000 the third year,” Byron recalled. “After that we tapered off—just 1,000 to 2,000 a year.” Planting also embraced acres and acres of pasture grass, weeds for wildlife cover and food, and wildflowers. By the time Byron retired in 1987, his 40-year stewardship had created a lush kingdom that now attracts sportsmen and families from hundreds of miles away. It’s an economic and environmental Fort Knox on the prairie. Byron and his wife, June, also were major forces in preserving Kingman County history. He served 10 years as president of the Kingman County Historical Society and June labored tirelessly as the museum’s volunteer curator. Was working a lifetime to preserve wildlife worth it? For Byron the answer wasn’t weighed on economic scales. “There’s a little bit of Daniel Boone in every one of us,” Byron mused. “Being outdoors is pacifying…it can calm your nerves. That’s the importance of wildlife areas.”";

The fearless lawman pinned on the Kingman marshal badge June 9, 1884. He was Kingman’s fourth marshal in less than six months. Work-hardened and solid, Fossett was an imposing figure at six feet, four inches and over 200 pounds. He didn’t say much, but always took decisive action. And he was a crack shot. “That man could shoot a bird out of the sky with a rifle, and he could snap a barbed wire fence with a pistol,” remarked Oklahoma’s Chief U.S. Marshal. A cowboy historian wrote, “Mr. Fossett was one of the great, though unpublicized, peace officers of the powder-stained Southwest, a man to mention with Wild Bill Hickok and Bat Masterson.” Taming Kingman was a fair-sized job. In early 1884, the Southern Kansas Democrat deplored the numerous lairs of Kingman vice. “The gambling dens of this town are getting to be more bold every week. At first, they were all run in rooms on alleys and other out-of-the-way places…(eventually) they secured rooms on the first floor of all the thoroughfares…there is where our sons are enticed.” This quickly changed. Four weeks after Bill became marshal, another paper reported the only places a man could gamble or find a drink was in a few barns a long way from main street. The only reason those were operating, it added, was because each place had four or five lookouts posted to give early warnings of a potential Fossett approach. Marshal Fossett also had to confront Mother Nature. In April 1885, a torrential rainstorm turned the Ninnescah into a raging monster nearly a mile wide. Kingman’s southside sunk. People were stranded, 11 houses, many barns, pig pens and coal sheds were swept away. Holding to a rope stretched across the river, Fossett, alone, made boat trips over the menacing Ninnescah to save marooned women and children. Citizens and newspapers widely proclaimed him as “our hero.” Fossett grew up as a Minnesota farmer’s son. He migrated to Texas as a teenager and made several cattle drives up the legendary Chisolm Trail. This took him to Caldwell. It was the first place a Chisolm Trail cowboy could legally get a drink after crossing the Red River in Texas. Fossett was Caldwell’s assistant city marshal in 1881-82, a time which the Wichita Times said “hell was in session” in Caldwell. His service was riddled by three major shoot outs, one of which caused the death of the city’s top marshal. For several years, Fossett held the distinction of being the only Caldwell marshal who wasn’t killed or wounded while in service. He came to Kingman County in 1882 to start a ranching partnership known as Red Stone on the south side of the Chikaskia River, near what eventually became Spivey. Later, he moved to Kingman and opened a livery stable on Sherman Street in partnership with Edgar Mead. Bill Fossett was restless. He never spent more than a few years in one location or job. This wandering may explain why he was married five times. Over a span of 43 years, Fossett held law enforcement assignments in nine rough and rugged places. Many involved shoot outs, knife fights, deaths and brawls. He served as U.S. Marshal in Oklahoma Territory, special agent for Rock Island Railroad, and as a peace officer in Kingfisher, Waurika and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Bill was 88 when he died in Kingfisher. At his funeral, he was commemorated as “a most fearless sort of man.” A former deputy, Joe Grimes, summed up Bill’s 40 years of law enforcement: “If Bill Fossett had an enemy, it was someone who did not know him. Even the prisoners…many of whom Bill had run down and put behind bars, all respected him and called him Uncle Bill.”";

For 50 years he prodded, pulled and pushed Kingman to grow…and he did it in a way that left nothing in his wake but improvements, friendship and accolades. He sparked progress with a cordial modesty and a sincere belief that anything was possible. “To every objection that this or that was “impossible” he had but one argument: ‘I have seen harder things that this done. What are you afraid of?’” reported the Kingman Journal in 1922. “All he did was to see new things Kingman ought to have and then begin talking to people about having them.” His obituary, in a matter of fact tone, said, “No man was more widely known in this county…and few were more highly respected. Whatever he did came natural to him, seemed to be no effort, and did not seem to him a thing to take credit for.” The history of Kingman is practically identical with the life story of Billy Child. He first saw the site of Kingman in 1872 while on a hunting trip from Hutchison. Attracted by the potential of the Ninnescah and its shallow crossing on the road to Medicine Lodge, he returned two years later, staked out a claim, settled and spent the winter in a riverbank dugout. It was in Billy’s shack that application was made to form Kingman. Over the years, Billy served the community in many capacities, including county surveyor, county clerk, commissioner, probate judge and Kingman’s first state legislator. He worked as county surveyor for 24 years, locating every corner in the county and setting the boundaries as they still stand today. Billy lobbied to build the first Kingman schoolhouse, a two-story frame building that stood on the hill near the present Carnegie Library. With his urging, the building also served as the first district court and housed Kingman’s first religious service, which was attended by Billy Child and three other men. Traveling to Hutchison and back, it was Billy Child who hauled the first wagon load of lumber to build the courthouse. For years, he was a persistent advocate of building a central water supply and spending money to pipe in the sparkling, spring water three miles west of town. It finally happened, and Kingman became famous for its sweet, clear water. Kingman also became famous for its rock salt. That, too, was a result of Billy Child. While drilling for oil northeast of town in 1887, Child and his associates hit a vast deposit of salt. Plans for oil drilling ended and the rock salt industry began. It was Kingman’s primary employer for 22 years. Walnut Hill Cemetery was planned, located, organized and named by Billy Child. The Grand Army of the Republic memorial within the cemetery was his idea. He was one of the organizers of the local G.A.R. post, as well as one of the founders of the Kingman Masonic Lodge. At his urging, hundreds of elm trees were planted throughout the town. When he died in 1922, all stores and offices closed to pay tribute to his 50 years of Kingman service. The Wichita Beacon wrote, “His neighbors honored him with a great public funeral, not because he was first in so many things, but because he loved to be helpful to his neighbors, loyal to the community, lovable in his optimism and did a world of good for pleasure and not for hopes of profit.” “They loved him because he quarreled with nobody, was generously public spirited and pulled his full weight of the community burdens.”";

He was a flamboyant horse trader and a champion stagecoach driver. With a contract to carry the mail and The Wichita Eagle newspaper from Wichita to Kingman, the pioneer entrepreneur was ready to make history. It was his first stage line. Serving areas not reached by the railroad, Green had a simple plan: Go fast, leave on time, arrive early, and do it with gusto. The recipe brewed fame and fortune. He named his stage line the Cannon Ball after the Wabash Cannonball, a steam train made famous by a popular folk song. Green’s stage was acclaimed for breakneck speed. Fresh horses were harnessed to coaches at relay stations every eight miles. Drawn by teams of six to eight horses, it usually took only two minutes to switch teams. ` Green bragged that not even Father Time could keep up with his stagecoaches. Advertisements shouted, “The Cannon Ball is the fastest stage in America.” Passengers were warned, “If you get left, do not blame the drivers, they have imperative orders to leave on time and make time.” The Cannonball helped build western Kansas. Initially, the stage line ran from Wichita to Kingman. Later, it stretched to Pratt, then on to Greensburg, a town named after him and which he helped found in 1886. Eventually it reached Liberal. This route evolved into U.S. Highway 54 and was known for many years as the Cannonball Highway. Standing six feet tall, Cannonball was described as a showy, boastful character. A rifle swung across his lap and a Bisley Colt swinging from his hip, Green boasted that none of his stages had ever been held up and his passengers had never lost a penny. However, once, he did lose a cigar to an intrusive passenger. The saloon- busting Carry Nation snatched a cigar from Green’s lips and launched an evils-of- tobacco lecture. Cannonball evicted her from the stage and lit a fresh cigar. Green’s stage line grew into 70 coaches and 1,000 horses covering 1,500 miles of Kanas plains. Green bragged that his top-of-the-line Concord coaches cost $1,200 and his good mules went for $400 each. Prosperity and Green were on a first name basis from 1870 to 1880. He wore diamond stickpins, built a mansion and bought his wife fine clothes and “more diamonds than all the other diamond owners west of the Mississippi.” The good times were far from his humble origins. When he was 10 years old, Green ran away from home. He and his older brother sneaked away from their Kentucky farm in the middle of the night. Headed for adventure in the wild West, they ended up in Montana. After a few years, he got a job driving a stagecoach and eventually became known as the “greatest overland stage plunger the world has ever known.” His feats with an eight-horse team were legendary. As the railroads moved west, demand for stage service dried up. Green’s fortunes fell. The “iron horse” busted him in western Kansas, so he moved to the wilds of Oklahoma to start a new stagecoach empire. The magic didn’t rekindle, and he was forced to support his family as proprietor of a traveling tent show. The tent was shredded by a phenomenal hailstorm. Then lawsuits and bad debts left him with only two mules, a wagon and a cow. With help from his brother, a California attorney, the Greens moved to the Golden State where Cannonball spent his last few years performing as a stagecoach driver in a wild west show.”";

But he jumped into those problems the same way he tackled broken-down farm implements-- with determination, vision and a desire to make things work. As a teenager, living in a sod house near the Rago trading post, Clyde was hailed as “a master with a monkey wrench.” There was no farm equipment he couldn’t repair. His reputation spread, and the Overland Farm and Car dealership in nearby Harper hired him as their top mechanic in 1907. Soon he was selling cars. In 1909 he moved to Enid, Oklahoma, and became a partner in the Overland car dealership there. His mechanical knowledge and plain-spoken farm ways made him an outstanding salesman. In his first year, he sold 100 cars. His life changed when he went to a flying circus. It featured three airplanes; only one could fly, and it was airborne only three minutes. But the brief flight sent Clyde’s imagination soaring. He wanted to fly. He took his life savings, $10,500, and went chasing his dream. To learn about aeronautical construction, he took a job in a New York airplane factory. After just a few weeks, Clyde decided he knew enough. He bought basic parts, shipped them back to Oklahoma, and built his own plane. Since he couldn’t afford an airplane motor, he got a 40-horsepower motorboat engine and modified it. Clyde named his home-made airship Silver Wings and aimed it for the clouds. He went to the Great Salt Flats of Oklahoma to teach himself how to fly. Trial-and-error lessons spanned eight months, produced 13 spectacular crashes and near bankruptcy. “My money was gone and my spirit was gone too,” Clyde said. “I would have quit then, but I didn’t dare. I made up my mind I would stick till I was starved.” Then came a touch of success. Silver Wings lifted him 75 feet above the salt flats and took him a few hundred feet down wind. When he tried to turn, trouble struck. trouble. “She skidded off and dropped down with a smack,” Clyde recalled. “They said I bounced like a rubber ball….the plane looked like it had been put through a thrashing machine.” Amid the Silver Wings wreckage, Clyde found a silver lining. “I knew that day that I could fly!” he declared. Propelled by determination and near poverty, the persistent entrepreneur moved back to Rago and into a barn on his old farm. His supportive wife, the former Europa Dotzour, an early day Kingman county schoolteacher, set up their home and raised their two small children in the hayloft. The lower level became a workshop where Clyde rebuilt his mangled plane. Within three months, the family was out of the barn, and Silver Wings again headed for the clouds. It was a successful flight – seven minutes, five miles in the air, and a smooth landing on December 17, l911-- just 11 months after Clyde had decided to reach for his high-flying dreams. The Kingman County farm boy flew to greatness: He became a flamboyant barnstormer, pilot of record-breaking racing planes, visionary aeronautical engineer and founder of a company that eventually became C.V. Cessna Aircraft Company—a company that built more light aircraft than any other in the world. He retired, at the age of 57, and returned to his Rago farm. His fame lived on. In 1978 he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame and was acclaimed as one of the 50 most influential people in the history of flight. Clyde Cessna accomplished all of this with just a fifth-grade education, a far- fetched dream and high-flying determination.”";

	document.getElementById("heritage-container_text").innerHTML = "“Nineteen thirty-five was a very special year in the history of music for Kingman. That was the year when four-year-old Delores Wunsch sat down at her family’s small, upright piano and plunked out a few, tentative notes. The wobbly tones were a prelude to a career that would take her to Carnegie Hall and beyond. “I was fascinated with the piano. It was magic,” Delores remembers. “I was so excited that my small fingers could make such beautiful sounds.” The little Kingman girl eventually became one of the most highly regarded classic pianists in the world. She went on to headline performances in many of the world’s most prestigious concert halls, recorded albums for 16 different labels and became a member of the Grammys’ board of directors. Her sparkling career stretches over 85 years and beyond. At 89 she was still making music, lots of it. She performed in 50 concerts, created several highly regarded compositions, and tutored special students. Delores was barely five when she got her first official lesson and first music book. “I sight read very well,” she said. “When I was eight, I started playing at Sunday school at the Presbyterian church. The song leader would surprise me with a new hymn almost every week. He was exuberant and sang loud and fast. Keeping up with him was a challenge.” She added, “By 10, I got my first job as accompanist. It was at the Methodist church. But I was soon fired, thanks to my Presbyterian experience, because I played too loud and too fast.” Another of her early musical jobs was working for her father. “My dad (Paul Wunsch, former president pro tem of the Kansas senate) was a powerful politician,” Delores recalled. “I was his little sidekick. I’d sing and dance and perform all the Shirley Temple songs at a lot of his campaign stops.” In Junior high she began lessons with the prominent Gordon Terwilliger at Wichita University. It was a six-hour, round-trip sojourn to his studio. Every week she would walk to Kingman’s Overland Hotel, catch the bus for a nearly two-hour trip to Wichita, take a taxi to WU, and get to immerse herself into exciting, new music frontiers for a fleeting hour before facing the long trek back to Kingman. She graduated from Kingman High in 1948 and from Kansas University in 1952. At KU she was named Outstanding Student of the School of Fine Arts each of the four years she was there. Her first post graduate job was in Hawaii teaching at a private prep school. Later she moved to Los Angeles, married Jim Stevens, a publicist for Paramount Studios, who worked with many noted movie stars such as Gary Cooper, Jimmy Stewart, Sophia Loren, and many others. Her support of contemporary composers led to a prestigious award from the National Association of Composers and the Presidential Award of Merit by the International Music Fraternity of Mu Phi Epsilon. She also was the recipient of the Living Legacy Award from the Young Musicians Foundation. It was presented by John Williams, one of the world’s most widely acclaimed cinematic composers. As a member of the Montagnana Trio, she gave over 500 concerts throughout Europe and North America. She toured Japan twice under the auspices of the US State Department and served three terms as governor of the National Association of Recording Arts and Sciences, governing body of the Grammys. In the field of music education, Delores was director of Chamber Music Studies for the Young Musicians Foundation in Los Angeles and a member of the music faculty at Mount St. Mary’s College for 40 years. For 20 years, she was director of Piano Studies at California State University. And, on the eastern seaboard, she co-founded and has worked for over 40 years with the Martha’s Vineyard Chamber Music Society. She currently serves there as artistic director and festival pianist.”";

	document.getElementById("heritage-container_text").innerHTML = "“When he was only 22, Don Dye sold his most prized possession, a three-year-old, Indian motorcycle, to raise money to go into business for himself. A high-school dropout, the Kingman County native was equipped with determination, a load of common sense, and a quick-silver mind that could waltz through complex mathematics, finance, and engineering problems. It was 1953 and a very lucky day for Kingman County. That’s when Don Dye, Inc. was founded with some savings and cash Don got from selling his motorcycle. The business quietly grew to become the oldest, largest, and most stable manufacturing company in Kingman’s history. It has pumped millions back into the Kingman County economy. Don Dye couldn’t go to high school. His father wouldn’t let him. Otis Dye made Don drop out of Kingman High School during his freshman year after only 30 days of classes. He proclaimed it was time for Don to start earning his keep. That put Don, age 13, behind a lathe at his dad’s blacksmith’s shop, which also turned out some tool and die work. The business was housed in a tin shed, smaller than most garages, at 602 S. Main. Nine years later, Don bought his father out, He started with one punch press and two employees--his mother, Mary, was the bookkeeper, and himself. Don wore many hats—manager, salesman, mechanical engineer, financial planner, draftsman, tool and die builder, and teacher. He would go sell and order, then hurry back to punch out the parts he just sold. Many times, orders were for a new product, so Don would draft its engineering plan, build its die, modify a press to produce the new specs, and then teach an employee how to make it work. “I always tried to build quality at a competitive price—a combination that sells,” Don said. It was a blue ribbon, success formula. This approach was coupled with heaps of modesty. He constantly used the word “we” in describing any aspect of the company’s operations, even when describing something he may have accomplished alone. His loyalty to employees was paramount. Wages and benefits were always at maximum levels. The company implemented a lush retirement plan. It was a true, profit-sharing program. Each year, Don set aside an unwavering per cent of profits. This was divided among all employees. Many retired with very comfortable, small fortunes. Don started his company by selling washers to hardware wholesalers, none farther away than Kansas City, and gradually expanded to include a wide range of stampings, unground ball bearings, oilfield walkways and V-belt pulleys. In 1978, the business lurched forward when Don acquired John Deere as a pulley customer. In 1980, the company moved into its current, spacious facility located in a pasture three miles west of Kingman. The plant spreads over 150,000 square feet, large enough to hold two football fields with room left over for bleachers. It’s a monument to do-it-yourself expertise and an impressive tribute to the power of “We.” Everything--all electrical wiring, all plumbing, and all construction, except for concrete work--was built by Don and his employees. Even the state-of-the-art architecture was completely created on Don Dye’s drawing board. All the company’s big equipment was purchased used. Don bought it from companies, hundreds of miles away, that were using it to perform functions other than stamping washers and pulleys. Don would ship the massive equipment, some weighed up to 60 tons, to Kingman. When it arrived, Don would ask his multi-tasking, skilled employees, many of whom were former farm hands, “Do you think you can make it work?” Before long, a machine that once produced thingamabobs in Chicago was pounding out V-belt pulleys in the Ninnescah Valley. There are 40 major presses at the Don Dye company. All were purchased used and then repurposed by the “We” crew. In 2007 tragedy struck. Don was severely injured in a traffic accident on his way back from Hutchison. He was never able to walk again. Even though he required constant, professional medical care, he still visited his plant. His oldest son, Max, would take him on frequent, wheelchair tours of the thriving business. On every trip, Don tried to visit all areas of the plant and chat with every employee. Afterall, Don insisted, it was the way “We” should do it.”";

Don Lock was a major league baseball star who played for the Washington Senators, Philadelphia Phillies and Boston Red Sox. His journey to fame started in Rago, population 212, where he played his first softball game. It was 1946, he was 11 years old, had never played in an organized ball game before, when he stepped on to the diamond to face a team of older boys, most of whom were teenagers. In those days, it was fast pitch and serious. But the Lock kid was good. With no experience and fueled with natural talent, he won a place on the highly rated team. Twelve years later, after graduating from Wichita University, he was signed by the New York Yankees. At WU, he was on a full-ride sports scholarship and starred in basketball, track and baseball. Twenty-four hours after leaving college, he was headed for the majors. “It was a busy week,” Lock recalled. I played my last college basketball game on Saturday night. On Sunday I met with six big league scouts, signed with the Yankees, and on the following Saturday got married in Kingman. Two days later, I was in spring training in Florida.” The Yanks already had an outfield filled with superstars, so Lock spent four years with the Yankees’ farm teams. He was traded to the Washington Senators in 1962 and made his major league debut with a splash. Playing against the White Sox in Chicago’s historic Cominskey Park, he rocketed a home run high into the upper deck, threw a runner out at third from deep left field, and won the game 1 to 0. He was picked as Player of the Game. Lock peppered the record books with ink. In 1963 he finished sixth in the American League with 27 home runs and 10 th in 1964 with 28 homers. He led the American League in outfield assists and put outs in 1962, and was named as the Washington Senators MVP. In eight major league years, playing with the Senators, the Phillies and the White Sox, his career statistics included a .238 batting average, 122 home runs, a .976 fielding percentage and 921 games. The farm boy from Rago was inducted into the Kansas Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974 and was a charter inductee into the Wichita State Shocker Athletics Hall of Fame in 1979. Then came the summit. In 2017 he was honored with induction into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame In 2015, Kingman named the road that rings Riverside Park as Don Lock Drive. It meanders past the former football field where Lock, for three years, was a star fullback for Kingman High School. He was a 1954 KHS graduate. The memorial road also circles Arnsdorff field, the baseball diamond where Don played many teenage ball games. The field hosts a bronze plaque honoring him. The galaxy of accolades never robbed Don Lock of his small-town roots. He frequently made appearances at Kingman County civic clubs, nursing homes and youth groups. Coaching and encouraging local boys, Lock often reminded them that a small town isn’t a liability to achieving big dreams. He once told a teenager, a kid who was complaining about the millstone of small-town disadvantages, “Look. Kingman has given you a lot…it’s everything you need to be successful. Go out and use it.” That incident was the inspiration that caused, Roger Rickard, one of Don’s old, former high school classmates, to begin the Kingman Heritage Hall of Fame. Hopefully, this gallery of Kingman County heroes will cause many more Kingman youngsters to go out into the world and use Don’s encouraging admonishment-“Kingman has given you a lot… It’s everything you need to be successful. Go out and use it.”";

	document.getElementById("heritage-container_text").innerHTML = "“Homer Baker was a fighting hero with a warm smile and a built-in likeability that quickly made strangers into friends. Beneath the pleasant exterior was a mountain of courage. He was the most highly decorated military hero in the history of Kingman county. During a 30-year U.S. Air Force career, Homer was awarded 38 medals. Leading the parade of ribbons were two Legion of Merit medals, an award that ranks among the nation’s highest, military honors. He also won two Distinguished Flying Crosses for heroism, five Air Medals for outstanding achievements and the Viet Nam Gallantry Cross with a palm and silver star. Homer moved to Kingman from Salina, Ks., when he was eight. At Kingman High he was quite popular and a standout athlete in all sports, especially football where he was named star halfback to the All Southern Kansas League team two years in a row. After school and on Saturdays, he worked as a delivery boy for the Payday Grocery store. Customers said their groceries came with the best smile in town. To say Homer Baker was a brave man is somewhat of an understatement. The 1939 KHS graduate went beyond the edge. He became a U.S. Army Air Corps reconnaissance pilot and in 1941 was assigned to an airplane that had cameras instead of machine guns and bullets. With no armaments, Homer was sent into WW II skies filled with Japanese planes intent on shooting him down. Serving as a photo recon pilot, flying a P-38 Lighting in in the South Pacific was a white-knuckle job. Not only was he without guns, but he had no escorts. Homer was on his own and solitary prey for enemy fighters. His only protection was speed, talent and quick thinking. Baker’s photos became lethal weapons. His pictures of enemy troop movements and gun emplacements significantly helped win the crucial battle of Guadalcanal, America’s first land victory in the South Pacific. Baker flew 200 lonely hours…80 missions…without being able to shoot back. One was the most highly secret and momentous missions of the war. It was Operation Oboe-Vengeance. The top five pilots in the entire U.S. Pacific theater—three fighter pilots and two recon pilots--were selected for the hazardous assignment. This operation climaxed with the shooting down of the airplane carrying Admiral Isoroko Yamamoto, Japan’s greatest military strategist and mastermind of the deadly Pearl Harbor attack. Killing Yamamoto is credited with substantially shortening the Pacific war. Homer’s film helped prove Oboe-Vengeance’s success. During the Korean Conflict, he flew 298 combat missions and 394 hours as a B-29 bomber pilot. In the Viet Nam War, he was commander of NhaTrang air base, home of the lethal AC-47 gunships. These planes were dubbed Spooky. Armed with 7.62 miniguns, a single Spooky could pump a bullet into every square yard of a football field-sized target area in less than 10 seconds. There are dozens of stories telling about AC-47’s coming to the rescue and saving soldiers’ lives. Combat reports show that no Viet Nam ground action was ever lost when it was under “Spooky” protection. Baker also logged exceptional performances as commander of two additional Air Force bases, an assignment at the Pentagon, and as executive commandant of the first class of cadets at the Air Force Academy. After 30 years, fighting in three wars, mastering 29 different kinds of airplanes, and commanding thousands of airmen, he retired. It was 1971; Homer was 51 and there was still time for a civilian career. So, he became a banker in Phoenix, Az., and served in executive positions there for the next 12 years.”";

It was during the Great Depression, and there wasn’t much money for art materials; so, he made do. An old, castoff bedsheet, India ink and broken crayons were his first art tools. Inspired by comics from the Sunday paper, the young, farm boy produced surprising results. Remarkably accurate images of Dick Tracy, Flash Gordon, Captain America, and other cartoon characters came to life on the tattered bedsheet. Those comic book heroes ushered Jack down a life-long road of creativity. Seventy-nine years later, he gave Kingman thousands of dollars-worth of his paintings that showcase real life heroes--Ninnescah Valley pioneers and icons who became superheroes with the help of their Kingman County heritage. Those paintings are the centerpiece of Kingman’s Heritage Hall of Honor. Theme of the exhibit is “You can get anywhere from Kingman.” Rickard is a good example of the theme. The strength of his small-town heritage helped him build success and propelled him through many environments after graduating from Kingman High School in 1953. At KHS, Jack excelled in sports. He became state champion in the 440-yard dash, Kansas welterweight Golden Gloves champion and halfback on the Kingman Eagles football team, once running 98 yards for a touchdown. At the College of Emporia, he ran on a sprint medley relay team that set a U.S. national record in 1955. In the Arizona Senior Olympics, where he logged his last racing victory when he was 80 years old, Jack was 400-meter champion numerous times from 1980 to 2014. To Jack, everything in life seemed to be a contest. Whether it was a boxing match, a running event, a football game, or in the classroom teaching American History; he wasn’t satisfied until he excelled. While in college he designed “Presby Pete,” the mascot for the College of Emporia. For nearly 30 years, until the college closed in 1974, it was the heralded battle emblem of the acclaimed “Fighting Presby” teams. In 2010 Jack was inducted in the College of Emporia Athletic Hall of fame. Three years later, the college recognized him with a Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions in literature, art, and education. Following college, Jack joined the Marine Corps; after the Marines, he tried many professions before finding the right career fit. It was being a high school history teacher. He earned a Ph.D. at Arizona State University in 1974 and taught high school history for 25 years; five of these were at Derby, Kansas, and 20 at Phoenix, Arizona, Central High, where he was acclaimed for innovative teaching. Dr. Rickard became director of the Phoenix magnet school and president of the Arizona Council of Social Studies. He was voted as the outstanding teacher at Phoenix Central and nationally honored for his imaginative techniques in teaching student teachers. Throughout the years, Jack continued drawing and painting, and after retiring from history teaching in 1990, he became a full-time artist. He rose to artistic prominence with shows in California, New Mexico, and Arizona galleries. During this period, Rickard also churned out an impressive array of creative writing. It includes three books of poetry and a trilogy historical memoirs. “My art and writing give viewers a way to travel to places that opens their self- imposed boundaries,” Rickard said. “I wander the museum of time searching for words and symbols that will do this. Sometimes I get lucky.” Yes, this time he was lucky…and so was Kingman. The Heritage Hall of Honor is resounding proof. It’s a showcase of outstanding examples of the power of a Kingman County upbringing in building success and breaking boundaries.”";

Just four years after graduating from Kingman High in 1903, she was teaching school in a remote village in Mexico. And four years after that, in 1911, on the other side of the world in Korea, she helped start what eventually became one of the world’s largest universities for women. Also, amid her many achievements: When she was only 23, Jean became deputy superintendent of schools in Kingman County. She probably was the first woman in Kansas to hold that position. Jean grew up on a 40-acre farm, one mile north of Kingman, where her father, David Walter, settled in 1886 after moving from Pennsylvania. The farm blossomed from a “scrubby cottonwood tree and a sandhill plum bush.” Her farther also worked at the Kingman mill and feed store. He gradually bought more land, raised more cattle and eventually prospered. In 1905 he became a co-founder of Kingman State Bank, the forerunner of KANZA Bank, and its second president. After high school, Jean entered Baker University, Baldwin, KS, to major in botany and biology. As a sophomore, she dedicated her life to Methodist mission work. Within two years Jean was teaching classes in Pachuca, Mexico, a very primitive environment. When she and another female teacher undertook a 50-mile horseback trip, local police offered to send soldiers to accompany them. The women declined and made the two- day trip alone. Jean was familiar with solitary travel. It was a necessity in 1905 when she was acting superintendent of Kingman County schools. She traveled alone in a horse-drawn buggy to visit and evaluate the 100 teachers scattered across the prairie. Many of her solitary treks lasted three and four days. In 1908 Jean returned from Mexico to complete her college degree. She enrolled Northwestern University, Evanston, IL. On weekends, she joined university missionary girls and went to the Chicago slums to help and teach. In November,1911, the adventuresome Kingman woman journeyed to Seoul, Korea. She was 26 and one of three teachers who turned Ewha primary school into a college. It eventually became Ewha Womans University. Today, its enrollment is nearly 22,000, and it’s one of the most influential and prestigious schools for women throughout Asia. In 1919 Korean students revolted against the Japanese army, occupiers of Korea since 1910. Leading the revolution was one of Jean’s students, a 16-year-old Ewha College girl, Yu Kwan-Sun. She was captured, sadistically tortured and died in prison. The brutal military despots, trying to hide Kwan-Sun’s torture, wouldn’t release the girl’s body. Jean Walter, at great risk, went to the prison and personally persuaded the sadistic officials to return the body. Afterwards, Jean directed funeral preparations and saw to it that Kwan-Sun received a hero’s burial. Koreans compare Jean’s actions to presiding over the last rites for George Washington. Even today, many Koreans praise Jean’s courage and honor the American schoolteacher for tending to their national hero of independence. When Jean returned to the U.S., she took a job as the first counselor at Wichita North High School when it opened in 1929. For the next 15 years, she inaugurated dozens of innovative counseling programs. Many of these became patterns for the entire state. One ground-breaking program required teachers to fill out “Reasons for Failure” cards for every student who failed two or more subjects. Jean then worked personally with each of these students for six weeks. Many never failed again. Another sample of Jean’s exceptional work was the one-page letter she wrote each week and mailed, along with a copy of the high school paper, to every Wichita North boy serving in WW II. Before the war ended, 500 weekly letters were going out to cheer the alumni soldiers and sailors.”";

	document.getElementById("heritage-container_text").innerHTML = "“Aboard a bucking bronc, John Mc Beth was poetry in motion. He made the pitching, jolting, punishing rides into dances of grace. His talent won him the title of World Champion Saddle Bronc Rider of 1974 and a career lofting him into three halls of fame: the Kansas Cowboy Hall of Fame (2008) the Professional Rodeo Hall of Fame (2010)—an incredible honor—and in 2013, the biggest distinction of all, the Hall of Fame of the National Rodeo Historical Society. McBeth’s stellar rodeo career started on a farm three miles west of Kingman and practice on the back of his dad’s Holstein milk cows. John was deeply impressed by his father’s cowboy life as a steer wrestler and trainer of rough horses. The son wanted to be like his rodeo dad and was anxious throw a saddle on every four-legged critter on the farm. However, one iron clad rule his father laid down was “Don‘t ride any horses when I’m not around.” Without seeking parental agreement, young John concluded their 35 milk cows weren’t off limits. “Cow riding was some of the best practice I ever had,” John recalled. But, one day his secret cow riding life came close to disaster. “Old Sway Back took one good jump out of the barn and I fell off. I hung my foot up in the stirrup and hung off her upside down for about an hour.” John graduated from Kingman High School in 1958. He competed in the state finals of the Kansas High School Rodeo Association in ’57 and ’58 and won a rodeo scholarship to McNeese College in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Throughout college, he competed in the Young Cowboy’s circuit and turned pro in 1963. His 32-year competitive career ranked among the rodeo elite, and he was never laid up because of serious injury. In his prime, he regularly entered 75 to 85 rodeos yearly. He climbed aboard broncs in an astonishing 129 rodeos during his national championship year. His last competitive ride was in 1988 in Yukon, Oklahoma, aboard Old Pain, one of the top, toughest horses of the rodeo circuit at that time. The “old man,” he was 48, scored 81 points, a great performance even for a top cowboy 20 years younger. Considering his successful career, McBeth said, “You’ve got to have the genetics to perform athletically, the will to succeed, and the right environment is crucial.” He also underlined the importance of the 10,000-hour rule: “It takes 10,000 hours (or 10 years) of practice to make anyone an expert at anything.” John was an inspiring teacher, too. For 41 years, he conducted exclusive bronc riding schools, limited to 20 riders per class, in South Dakota. McBeth’s methods produced cowboys who went on to win every major rodeo in North America. They resulted in nine world champion bronc riders, one world champion calf roper, and one all-around, world champion cowboy. “You can’t make champions, but you can teach the basics and build confidence,” McBeth said. “I had simple rules. I wouldn’t allow anyone to intimidate someone else, and I wouldn’t allow anyone to act like a hotshot.” Positive reinforcement was a keystone of his teaching. No one was allowed to say anything negative about another rider or about themselves—they were permitted only to talk about the things they had done correctly. Summing up McBeth’s career, a biographer wrote, “…the name of John McBeth knocked down doors in the rodeo world like a Kansas tornado…(his friends) told me John was an exceptional person with an unconquerable spirit who, in anything he chose to do, would have been labeled as a champion.”";

	document.getElementById("heritage-container_text").innerHTML = "“John Riggs left his Indiana home, moved to the Waterloo community in 1885, and became a schoolteacher. Gazing through the classroom window one day, he was struck by the starkness of the prairie. So, he decided to do something about it. At the time, an early settler described the Kingman area as “a sea of white sand…Not a blade of grass nor tree was in sight. In the entire county, there was only one tree, a cottonwood.” Riggs began an intense study of horticulture, which he put to practical use by ordering exotic trees and bushes and planting them in a grove near his house. His ambition was to discover species that were best adapted to the barren prairie. He established Southwestern Nurseries in 1887. His successful grafting and unusual techniques quickly gained national prominence. Amazed scientific horticulturalists began visiting Waterloo to meet the schoolteacher with the green thumb. By grafting plum, pear and fig branches into the root of the common sand plum, he was able to transform the relatively worthless into the valuable. Other experiments enabled him to grow luscious European grapes from the roots of wild fox grape. He created corn that yielded 50 bushels per acre and wouldn’t burn under the roasting Kansas heat. The stock came from two varieties Riggs obtained from equatorial Africa. He crossed the African strains with the best large corn he could find from Mississippi. Riggs requests for rare plants from the U.S. Department of Agricultural resulted in a visit from a department officer in 1900. Consequently, Riggs was appointed government forester with the authority to select trees and plants from any place on earth, and to make any experiment he chose without interference from any superior officer. It was a bureaucratic blessing that produced a bountiful harvest. By 1909, the 35-acre Riggs homestead had grown into a fertile oasis. It had thousands of trees, shrubs and plants. The Kingman Journal noted “One may see nursery cranberries from Alaska…rare fruit from Argentine…cedars from Lebanon… olives from the hills overlooking Jerusalem…oranges from Jaffa…the royal oak from England…cypress trees from southern swamps…and lotus from the waters of the Nile.” Riggs, also was praised by Kingman’s other paper. The Leader-Courier wrote, “Mr. Riggs impresses one as a bundle of ideas. He has done a great deal for the people of Kansas.” The Waterloo experimental center became “one of the most noted stations of its sort in the United States.” After nine years working for the U.S. government, in 1909, Riggs concluded he couldn’t afford to devote all his time to federal business. He resigned and acquired an unusual governmental agreement. He was given sole ownership of the Waterloo station, which was then moved under the private umbrella of Southwestern Nurseries, and was made a special federal consultant. Tragedy struck in 1930. The Riggs home, nestled in the middle of the experimental oasis, burned to the ground. Riggs, 79, and all his extensive research records were lost. His son, Cecil “Cap” Riggs took over Southwestern Nurseries and continued much of his father’s experimentation. The retail operation was moved to Kingman in 1945. It’s still open and being operated today by Roy Riggs, John’s grandson. It is the oldest nursery in Kansas. Many of the unusual, original trees, now over 130 years old, still stand in the Riggs Arboretum at the Waterloo site. Among them is a breathtaking, majestic English oak, four towering cypress trees, a very special Chinese rubber tree and dozens of others. All are splendid examples of how a visionary schoolteacher made Kingman County a better place in which to live.”";

	document.getElementById("heritage-container_text").innerHTML = "“John Vanlandingham was blinded when he was six years old. Scarlet fever and its complications turned his world black in 1927. The third youngest of eight children, John was born on a small ranch north of Spivey. He not only prevailed in a sightless, remote, back-country world, he squeezed a huge harvest of success from it. John went on to ride horses, play baseball, graduate from law school, become a prominent political and civic leader, a superior court judge, and an activist for thousands of blinded people. “Being blind may limit your sight,” John said, “but it certainly shouldn’t bother your vision.” A few months after darkness hit his life, John was sent to Kansas City where he was enrolled in the Kansas School for the Blind. For eight years he learned braille reading and writing, arithmetic, and broom-making. Back then, nearly 100 years ago, making brooms was considered one of the few ways for a blind person to make a living. John excelled at it. The Blind School selected him to demonstrate the craft at the school’s booth at the Kansas State Fair. John spent summers and holidays on the Spivey ranch working and playing with his four brothers and three sisters. They were excellent, caring teachers, consistently challenging, making him do his share of ranch chores, and not above pulling pranks on him. John had his own horse, a mare named Nancy. He rode her everywhere, even helping to herd cattle. His siblings would yell directions and guide him around obstacles. One day, his oldest brother, Dick, called out for him to help head off a straying cow and calf. “Go to the left and go fast,” were the urgent, shouted directions. John and Nancy, at a full gallop, splattered right into a deep stock pond. In the summer of 1935 John rebelled. “I’m not going back,” he proclaimed and refused to return to the School for the Blind and broom-making. So, the teenager became a freshman in Kingman High School, the first blind student to walk through its halls and attend daily classes. His brother, Lynn, a year younger, spent countless hours reading high school lessons to John. Lynn disliked the reading chore and firmly refused to read any lesson more than once. This caused John to listen closely and that cultivated a nearly photographic memory. After high school, John enrolled at Washburn University and law school in Topeka. Once again, he became the first blind student in a school’s history. After graduating, he went back to Kingman and was soon elected County Attorney. It was 1945 and John moved into a home two blocks from his office. Daily, he walked to and from work by himself. He adamantly refused to be escorted. He also refused to carry a white, red-tipped cane, the traditional device that most sightless people use to feel their way along and to caution vehicle traffic. Two years later, arthritis and general health conditions caused John to move to Arizona. The warmer, dryer climate proved to be good medicine. In 1960 the governor appointed him Assistant Attorney General in charge of a staff of 21 attorneys. Three years later he was elected to the Arizona House of Representatives, and in 1966 was appointed as judge of Maricopa County Superior Court. While in the state legislature, John became recognized as an expert on every piece of legislation. He had a secretary read aloud to him—twice—each bill that was introduced. By the session’s end, he had stored in his mind the basic wording of over 600 bills. John was founder and president of the first Little League baseball organization in Chandler, Arizona in 1954. He frequently played ball with his two sons; one would bat, one would field, and John would pitch. The batter would shout “Here!” John would pitch toward the batter’s voice. His resume bulged with achievements. To name a few: He was president of the Chandler Junior Chamber of Commerce, organized and served as first president of the American Blind Lawyers Association, also helped organize the Arizona Council of the Blind, and became it first president. He founded the Arizona Council of the Blind Federal Credit Union, served as chairman of the National Credit Union of the American Council of the Blind, and as a member of the national advisory committee on handicaps for the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare. While pioneering the many handicap programs, John frequently reminded audiences of the definition of a handicap. It came from his early days of ranching and working horses…”A handicap is a burden placed on a superior horse to make the race more even.”";

He organized dozens of Kingman bands and caused countless prairie homes to have pianos and organs. The musical icon even brought national attention to Kingman and its musical kids. Capps was a 22-year-old musical pioneer, literally. He arrived in Kingman in 1879 with his brother from Mt. Pulaski, Ill. There were no dance halls, no opera house, no schools and no people who wanted to learn how to make music. “It was a sorry and desolate place…a bed of sand,” Oscar recalled many years later. ”Just a few straggling houses of primitive fashion and the outlook was anything but encouraging for a couple of boys fresh from the east.” He joined his brother-in-law, P.J. Conklin, publisher of the Kingman Citizen, one of Kingman’s first newspapers. The musician became a “printer’s devil” doing odd jobs around the office and mainly gathering Heifer City coal to keep the office stove burning. While trying to prime the Kingman music pump, he also traveled to Medicine Lodge and Winfield. In each town, he started small bands; however, they didn’t thrive, and he soon focused on Kingman and become a sheep herder. Oscar staked a claim on the Cleveland ridge, built a sod house, and bought 200 head of sheep. One of his key herding tools was a flute. Stories were told how Oscar would spend nights on a hillside serenading his sheep and the coyotes with lonely flute tunes. Frequently the concerts ended when his neighbor, one hill to the east, got tired of the coyote chorus and fired off several Winchester shots to request a silent night. The sheep business was bad. Oscar just wasn’t a drover; he was a music director. He moved to town in 1883 and opened a modest music shop in the corner of S.B. Livingston’s Furniture store. His first sale, a house organ, went to “Uncle Joe” McPeek “who lived out near the town of Maud,” Beautiful music followed…lots of it. The Kingman Silver Cornet band was organized. It had 13 members, and they hired Capps as music director. His pay was one Indian pony, valued at $50, for 48 lessons. Oscar was a gifted teacher. His bands were popular, numerous and some were famous. His Knights of Pythias band was voted the best band in Kansas by over 400 band men assembled in Kingman for a band tournament. That band also became the official Kansas band in the Republican National Convention in Chicago in 1888. And in 1904, the Capps Kids Band, decked out in splendid red uniforms, became the toast of the Democratic National Convention in Denver. A newspaper reported, “the Kingman band covered itself with glory at the convention...By common consent, it headed a monster William Jennings Bryan parade. The way it played the official convention march brought forth cheers until the streets of Denver rang.” Praise for the music man was prolific. In 1921, The Kingman Journal wrote, “He has started more musicians than any man in Kansas outside of a regular music school with classes.” Another article lauded his honesty and hard work. “The purchaser of an instrument, whoever he is, knows very well that if there is the least crack, the least missed tone, the least trouble whatever with his instrument, there is a good and absolutely reliable businessman right on the spot to make it good.” After 37 years and doing business in a dozen different Kingman locations, Oscar Capps retired. In 1921 he took down his well-known and well-worn sign which read “Oscar Capps, Dealer in Musical Merchandise.” In a farewell story, The Leader-Courier observed, “(Capps) retires with a record untarnished by a single unworthy act in more than forty years residence here as neighbor and businessman.”";

It was a tribute to his power and fairness and thick silver hair. Whether you were for him or against him, his work mirrored the grandeur of refined politics and common- sense reasoning. Paul Wunsch spent 37 years in politics, beginning in 1927 as Kingman County attorney. He was in the Kansas House of Representatives for 18 years, 1936-1944, and the state Senate for 20 years, 1944-1964. During these 28 years in the Legislature, Wunsch held nearly every major position of leadership. He became the second man in the history of Kansas to have served as both speaker of the House and president pro tempore of the Senate. “It is said, he (Wunsch) runs the affairs of Kansas for 90 days every two years from a cubbyhole office behind the Senate rostrum. The rest of the time, the governor is in charge—chained to Wunsch legislation,” reported The Kansas City Star in a 1963 article. An unsuccessful race for governor in 1964 concluded the Silver Knight’s political safari, but not his public service. In 1969 Wunsch was appointed to the Kansas Board of Regents by Gov. Robert Docking who said, “He was a dominant figure, highly regarded not only in Kansas, but throughout the country.” Wunsch held the position until 1977. Born in Harper County in 1901, Wunsch attended public schools and graduated from Argonia High School in 1919. In 1924 he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Kansas and received his law degree from KU the following year. One year later, he moved to Kingman to begin his law practice. It was said that he left his touch on all major laws that passed during his 28-year tenure as a state leader. Among his hallmark achievements was the act that brought Wichita University into the state system of education in 1963. Other successes were in obtaining tax reform, state aid for elementary schools, reforms in mental health, probate codes, welfare procedures, workmen’s compensation and providing state assistance for exceptional students. A fellow legislator, describing Sen. Wunsch, said, “I was not always on his side on some controversial measures, but I can attest that those with him and against him were conscious at all times of his fairness, his courtesy and his thorough understanding.” A legislator from an opposing party remarked, “If there was a pet program we sponsored, you sure wanted Paul as an ally. If he ever took off after you, you were hurting.” After Paul died, 16 years after he left the Senate, the state capitol still felt his presence. A former colleague rose on the Senate floor and proclaimed, “Paul R. Wunsch… was a man of very rare quality--a quality to make each member of the Senate feel important. He had the leadership quality to be fair and kind, yet firm.”";

	document.getElementById("heritage-container_text").innerHTML = "“He always greeted everyone with a smile, a warm “How ya doin?” and a huge dose of understanding. For decades he made Kingman feel good, lifting the spirits of anyone he visited with. Pearl was a gem, a rough jewel of many facets…a dog catcher, shoeshine man, butcher, farmer, trash hauler, landlord, counselor, and son of a slave. Wherever Pearl went, he carried sunshine with him and turned strangers into good neighbors. His biggest contribution? Pearl gifted Kingman a vast lesson in racial tolerance with hardly ever saying a single word about the subject. It was during a period when “sundown towns” dotted Kansas. And Kingman County, during the mid-20th century, had its share of intolerance. Yet, Pearl Banks befriended all and became a sterling example of what a good, good neighbor should be. His wide-spread popularity was evident during Kingman’s 1983 centennial. Pearl was chosen to be the town’s honorary centennial judge. As Kingman’s dog catcher for 35 years, Pearl was paid 50 cents to catch and euthanize stray dogs. Most of his catches got reprieves. He would find homes for many by giving them to boys and girls throughout the county. Lots of kids bragged about having a Pearl dog. Pearl’s father, Joe Banks, was 14 when he was freed from slavery in Virginia at the end of the Civil War. He was a pioneer who came to Kansas in 1887. The quarter section of prairie land that Joe homesteaded eventually became the town site of Pretty Prairie. Eighteen years later he and his boys were farming a full section—all by hand and horses. “I walked many a mile behind a mule team,” Pearl reminisced. “I remember my brother and I put in 100 acres of wheat with a walking plow. I’d walk one round, and he would walk the next round. We didn’t mind—we didn’t know no different.” In 1925, Pearl left farming and moved to Kingman where he found work in a variety of places for the next 62 years. “I butchered for 35 cents an hour, then I’d go to the barber shop and shine shoes for a dime, then I’d go do my janitor work, and then I’d go home and feed the hogs and milk the cows,” Pearl said. “When you got a nickel or dime ahead you thought it was pretty nice.” The pioneer entrepreneur also started a trash hauling service. In 1930, for a paltry 25 cents, he would load his truck full of refuse and take it to the city dump. He had about 40 regular customers. “That was one job I really enjoyed,” Pearl remarked. “I was out meeting people and they were always nice to me.” He became well liked and well off. Over the years, Pearl gradually purchased land and homes on the south side of Kingman. Eventually, he owned around 90 acres with rental houses and croplands. Much of the property was inside the city limits. During the 40’s, 50’s and 60’s, Kingman’s Main Street was a gathering place, especially on Saturdays. It was where both town and country folks all went to catch up on news about their neighbors, the weather, and the price of wheat. Impromptu conversations flared up in barber shops, drug stores, stairwells and in groups of two or three folks leaning on the front fenders of their parked cars. Main Street was alive with visiting…and Pearl was the center of many of the confabs which ranged an inch deep and a mile wide on countless subjects. Over the years, Pearl became one of the most identifiable, respected and well-liked men in town. When he celebrated his 95th birthday from a hospital bed, scores of well-wishers came to honor him. He was a pioneer who homesteaded on the hearts of Kingman.”";

	document.getElementById("heritage-container_text").innerHTML = "“Sometimes, change and payback can take a long time to take root. That’s a truth that fits Roger Rickard. He grew up on remote farms in Kingman County. Born during the Great Depression of the 1930’s, Roger spent his early years in one-room schoolhouses and vacant Kansas prairies that stretched into the empty forever. Eighty-six years later, after traveling half-way around the world and savoring four different careers, Roger came back to Kingman and returned a gift that his hometown gave him when he was a kid—the power of Kingman County values and vision. It was wrapped in the grand opening of the Kingman Heritage Hall of Honor, a gallery of paintings and stories showcasing Kingman County heroes. Roger and his older brother, Jack, a prominent Arizona artist, worked four years and two lifetimes to create the Kingman tribute. Heritage Hall, opened in 2021, is a dynamo of inspiration and role models, men and women who made a big impact on Kingman and Kansas--some of them even changed the world. It’s compelling proof that Kingman fosters people who can accomplish big things. Roger was especially lucky. He personally knew over half of the Heritage giants when he was growing up. As a teenager they helped mold him to eventually become an accomplished newspaper writer, a crack public relations specialist, a risk-taking entrepreneur, and a pretty good salesman. Roger’s Kingman County upbringing gave him a fertile, creative imagination. He filled the empty wheat fields and pastures of his boyhood with adventures. Buffalo Bill, Geronimo, the Rough Riders, Roman legionnaires, Air Force aces, and Gene Autry were just a few of the people who lived in Roger’s endless prairies. Many might have thought these daydreams were wasted time. Not so. They were fertilizer for a creative lifestyle that was yet to come. At Kingman High, 1950-54, Roger easily made friends. He was active in sports, theater, music, journalism, and was president of the senior class. At the College of Emporia, he served two successive years as student body president, and also was elected leader of the federation of student governments of all colleges in the KAKC Conference. After college, Roger let his wanderlust loose. He hitchhiked across eastern America and throughout Europe for nearly a year. The junket was mostly financed by writing a newspaper column titled “Poor Rickard’s Almanac,” a weekly column about his hitchhiking adventures. The wandering took him on an errant, midnight walk through New York’s Hell’s Kitchen, a riot in London’s Trafalgar Square, and a dash through a bunch of drunken, knife wielding fishermen on a Mediterranean island. He also appeared with the prestigious Vienna Opera in a performance of Madam Butterfly, saved a drunken Octoberfest celebrator from a fiery accident in a German beer hall, and hitchhiked over the Pyrenees Mountains in a snowstorm. Back in America in 1961, he embarked on a career as a daily newspaper reporter, special features writer and photographer. He covered crime, politics, and human-interest stories. His byline was commonplace in the Tulsa World for several years. Then came corporate public relations with Sunray DX, a Fortune 500 company and America’s fifth largest petroleum company. In addition to national business stories about Sunray, Roger generated mounds of publicity for the company’s international sports car racing program where he worked with movie stars and racing greats. To get out of the big city buzz box, Roger moved to the Missouri Ozarks in 1970. For the next decade he worked in Joplin with four different advertising agencies, serving regional and national accounts. In 1988 he founded a publishing company specializing in Victorian lithographs and limited-edition, fine art prints. His company had 88,000 customers and represented four of America’s leading artists when it nose-dived in 1998. Roger was 62 years old, eligible for Social Security, and broke. So, he launched another career. He became a salesman for Heartland Payment Systems, a start-up credit card processing company. Twenty-four years later, Heartland had become one of America’s largest processors. Roger, age 86, retired with over 400 customers in four states. Kingman gave Roger a super-sized appetite for variety, the imagination to create something out of nothing, and the stamina to keep plugging along, even when tough times stomped on dreams. Reflecting on his Kingman heritage, Roger quoted an old Ozark saying. “It’s easy to whittle when you’ve got good wood…and Kingman County sure grows good wood.”";

Sadie was affectionately known as “the woman who gets things done.” It was a fitting description. Her talents were many and varied. She was a schoolteacher, a pioneer career woman, a community leader, an organizer, a political spearhead, and a person who genuinely cared about others. Without Sadie Jurney, Kingman probably wouldn’t have much history. She started the Kingman County Historical Society in 1961, and eight years later led the campaign to save Kingman’s historic 1888 city hall and firehouse. The monumental structure was scheduled to be razed and turned into a gasoline service station. Then Sadie came to the rescue. “Sadie Jurney said ‘Nobody is tearing down that building,’” recalled Gayle Dye, former president of the Historical Society. “Because of Sadie, and Sadie alone, this building was saved.” Initially, Sinclair service station owners offered $25,000 for the building and lot. Over the next two years, Sadie drummed up community support and salvation funds. At a special meeting of the City Commission, with standing room only, on October 20, 1969, the Historical Society announced it would pay $5,000 for the building and turn it into a museum. Commissioners eventually accepted the offer with a single caveat—the building was to revert back to the city if the planned museum closed within five years. Decades later, the beautiful “Old City Building” stands as a tribute to Kingman County pioneers and is the citadel of their history. It has been placed on the National Historical Register and is one of the finest, small town museums in Kansas. Sadie’s family were Kingman pioneers. Her father, Charles Fowler, moved to Kingman in 1880. He was a business visionary. In 1987 he was delivering ice to Kingman homes and businesses; in 1920, as a city commissioner, he proposed, promoted and supervised the building of Kingman’s first municipal swimming pool; in 1923 he bought the old Garfield Opera House, Avenue A and Cedar, and turned it into the Fowler Apartments. Sadie graduated from Kingman High School in 1917. At KHS she was a gifted student, a prize-winning orator, editor of The Oracle, and was nominated as one of the prettiest girls in school. That fall she started teaching at Bickel country school. She rode to the school, nine miles east of Kingman, on horseback. She moved on to teach physical education in Kingman High. Her interest in local history led her, in 1925, to create and direct a four-act pageant about Kingman’s early days. It was a city-wide affair with a 225-member cast featuring actors from civic clubs, churches, and schools. The extravaganza became the center piece of ceremonies dedicating the newly constructed high school gymnasium. Sadie ended her 12-year teaching career and became a pioneering physical therapist in 1929, one of the first in the U.S. Army’s newly commissioned physical therapy department. In 1936, stationed in Hawaii, she married Col. Claude Jurney. They were living in Honolulu when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941. Sadie returned to Kingman early in 1942. She devoted the next 39 years and mountains of energy to local and state-wide activities, many of which she spearheaded as president. Her leadership sparked notable success. For example, under her leadership in 1957 the Kansas Women’s Republican Club grew to 7,000 influential members. A sample of Sadie’s additional stewardship roles include president of the PEO Sisterhood, worthy matron of the Order of Eastern Star, president of the Hospital Auxiliary, president of the 19 th Century Club, regent of the Daughters of the American Revolution, director of the Episcopal Ladies Guild, key roles in the Girl Scouts, American Legion Auxiliary, VFW Auxiliary, and, of course, president, founder and curator of the Kingman County Historical Society and Museum. Yes, Sadie made lots of things happen.”";

Lots of them left “Steve’s” looking at life differently. With a few, well-chosen words, the soft-spoken barber gently guided hundreds of teenagers into becoming better athletes while also nudging them several steps closer to manhood. “Steve George made you look good and play better,” exclaimed one of Steve’s former teenage customers. It was 60 years later, and the once upon a time Kingman football player was reminiscing about a Steve George haircut that included a tip about ratcheting up his passing game. “That little pep talk did wonders for my self-confidence. It changed my game and my life.” For 35 years the barbershop at Main and Avenue B was ground zero for male hair styles and sports. Flat tops, crew cuts, ducktails and sedate preacher trims, Steve did them all with skill and a special human relations touch. His positive attitude was legendary. Contemporaries cannot recall hearing him say a negative word about another person. In 1938 The Leader-Courier observed, “Above everything else, Steve has had the admiration and respect not only of his players, but of the community as well. They know him as a calm, friendly sort of a guy, who likes a good joke and would think well of a person a hundred times before he would think ill of him.” As a youngster, Steve was a stand-out rodeo entertainer. He, along with a younger sister and brother, performed as a headlined, trick roping team. Part of their allure was their Indian heritage. Their father was a French Canadian Indian. Apparently, crowds enjoyed seeing Indians out-rope the cowboys. In 1926 Steve came to visit relatives in Kingman and never left. The reason was a pretty brunette, Hellen Burger, who played the piano for the silent movies at the Meade Theater. The trick roper got roped, and the two entertainers tied the matrimony knot shortly afterwards. Jobs for fancy ropers in Kingman were nonexistent, so Steve launched a new career. He went to barber college in Wichita; then he started improving the looks of Kingman men and boys in 1928. Seven years later, he began working for Sank Coberly at Main and B streets. Steve finally purchased the business in 1949 and operated it for another 20 years. “Steve’s” became the center for sports enthusiasts. Steve loved sports, and sportsmen loved Steve. All sports were in season at the barber shop, all the time…baseball, fly fishing, basketball, bowling, football, hunting, golf. And Steve seemed to know all the scores, all the teams, all the players, and how they played. Always with a positive spin, Steve would quietly offer suggestions and observations that would improve talent, techniques and strategy. Coaches and Saturday morning quarterbacks, even those who didn’t need a haircut, would show up to replay Friday night games and get Steve’s input. Steve was a fixture at high school football and basketball home games. He seldom missed one. And he was more than a spectator. Over the years, he coached and sponsored dozens of baseball, basketball and bowling teams. Both he and Helen were hole-in-one golfers and impressive bowlers. Ranking at the apex of his accomplishments were the dozens of summer baseball programs which he launched, sponsored and encouraged civic clubs to host. Hundreds of Kingman boys were impacted. Once, when asked why he spent so much time with youth sports, Steve softly replied, “Teach a boy to play and he will work better…for himself and for the world.”";

In Kingman County medical history, she was the first and last of her kind. In 1987 she became the first woman doctor to practice in Kingman County and when she retired, 32 years later, she became the last General Medical Practitioner in the county. By popular standards, her medical career was highly unlikely. It wasn’t launched until she was a housewife, nearly middle-aged, caring for an ailing husband, four adolescent children and making do with a minimum wage job. That was when she entered nursing training. Eight years later, 1986, she graduated as the top student in her medical school class, the first woman in the school’s history to achieve that summit. A year later, Dr. Lester Donley invited her to join him in Kingman at the Donley Memorial Clinic which his father, J.B. Donley, opened in 1947. It was homecoming for Dr. Vicki. She was born and raised in Kingman County, went to grade school in Penalosa and graduated from Cunningham High School. “This is home,” Moots said. “I wanted to come back here. Growing up, when we had to go to the doctor, we came to the Donley’s clinic. It was like coming home.” Most Kingman people were never aware of the challenges that Dr. Vickie endured to reach that homecoming. They mostly only knew her as warm and passionate physician who had a warm, comforting, personal touch. And that touch was almost as healing as any prescribed medication. It helped good health and smiles to flourish. Becoming a doctor was childhood occupation. “My parents never knew what I was going to bring home,” Dr Moots recalled. “Injured dogs, racoons, birds…anything but snakes. I didn’t know particularly how to treat them. I just took care of them and most of them got better.” The medical die was cast when an elderly woman patted little Vicky’s head and said, “You would sure make a cute nurse.” The young care giver shot back, “I’m won’t be a nurse. I will be a doctor.” A native of Penalosa, Victoria DeLaRosa graduated from Cunningham High in 1965. She was valedictorian of her class. Her steadfast determination was already at work. Remembering those first days after high school, Dr. Moots said, “There was no money for college. We were so poor we didn’t even have indoor plumbing. I looked and looked until I found a college that would grant me a full tuition scholarship.” It was Grace and Glory Bible School in Kansas City. Vicky was aspiring to become a medical missionary. To pay dormitory and food expenses, she tutored other students and got an outside job. One day, while on a bus going to work, she met her future husband, Larry Moots from LaPlata, Mo. They were married after Vicky’s college graduation. It was 1968 when the graduate became a home maker and family life quickly became a full-time occupation. Over the next l0 years, the Moots had four children. The kids were 2, 4, 6 and 8 years old when hard times struck. They were living in Hutchison and Larry was working at Cessna Aircraft where he injured his back and became housebound. With determined research, Vicky discovered a program at Hutchison Junior College that paid her a minimum wage working as a nurse’s aid while also taking classes that would lead to a nursing degree. It was a good fit, until a faculty shortage altered the program, leaving the young breadwinner without a nursing certificate and no improved salary prospects. Another year, maybe even two, of classes were required to become a nurse. So, she was forced to take a second career detour. She headed back toward her childhood dream. “I just decided that if God closed the door on nursing, I would pursue something higher.” She opted to go for a pre-med degree at Sterling College, a 45-mile commute to the north. Armed with a straight A transcript from Hutch Juco, Vicky obtained several Sterling grants and scholarships. Tutoring college students in math and English brought in income. Car pooling with another Hutchison-Sterling student cut expenses. Looking back on the challenges of class work, tutoring, communing, mothering and home- cooking, Dr. Moots remarked, “We survived, let’s put it that way.” In two years, she graduated with honors. Then the family moved to Dallas when she received an armload of grants and scholarships at Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine. Classes were much more demanding, but the routine was similar—it was a full mix of classwork, study, tutoring other students for extra money, mothering four children, and caring for a recuperating husband. She graduated at the top of her 93-member class. It was the first time the medical school’s history that a woman had achieved that pinnacle. She was nearly 40 years old and her children were 16, 14, 12 and 10. Her 32-year medical career in Kingman was a kaleidoscope. In addition to a huge patient load at the clinic, she served as Kingman County health officer, EMS medical director of Kingman, Norwich and Cunningman, medical director of five nursing homes and Kingman County coroner. For 14 years she spent two-weeks each summer as a medical missionary in Costa Rica.”";
